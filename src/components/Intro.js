                <p>This is how it works: go through a series of flashcards and indicate if you <span className="green">know this word (green tick)</span> or <span className="red">donâ€™t (red cross)</span>.</p>
                    
                <p>The test starts with the most basic words and will automatically increase the difficulty if you easily go through the simple parts.</p>

                <p>At the end you get the estimation of your CEFR level and vocabulary size.</p>

                <p>Test words are randomly chosen every time you take the test.</p>
